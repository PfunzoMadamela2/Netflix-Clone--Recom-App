Each prompt guided the AI in developing the Netflix-style recommender.

Prompt 1 established the use of Flask + React + Tailwind and the dataset features.
Prompt 2 requested the full runnable code with all components included.

The outputs were integrated directly into the final system.
Adjustments included adding trailer support, smooth animations (Framer Motion), and a modular file structure for clarity.

Reflections:
- The AI effectively generated complete working code.
- Future improvements: integrate TMDB API for dynamic poster images and live updates.
